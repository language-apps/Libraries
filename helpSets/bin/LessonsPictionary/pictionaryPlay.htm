<h1 align=center>Executing Pictionary Lessons</h1>

<p>When you execute a Pictionary lesson, you will see a series of pictures shown on the frame. If there are more than can
fit, a scroll bar will enable you to view all of them. When you click on one of the pictures, you will 
see the gloss (first language) translation, indigenous spelling, and additional descriptive information attached to
the picture.</p>

<p>On the bottom of your display you will see a row of buttons that are standard across all lesson types. For more 
information <a href="../commonHelpSets/playControls.htm">Click Here</a>. For many lesson types, clicking on the middle button
(<img src="../commonHelpSets/playControls/info.png">), cause a pop up menu to appear, which have options that are 
unique to each lesson type. Pictionary lessons have no special options, so clicking on this button will simply beep.</p>
