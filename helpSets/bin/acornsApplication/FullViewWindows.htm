<p>The full view windows command is a selection on the windows menu. If more than one file is active, 
only one file will display in the data panel (to the right) of ACORNS application frame. Full view contrasts 
with the <a href="TabbedViewWindows.htm">tabbed view</a>. Full view is the default way that ACORNS displays 
lesson data.</p>
