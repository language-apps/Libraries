<p>The tabbed view command is a selection on the windows menu. If more than one file is active, 
a tabbed panel appears in the lesson data area that displays to the right of ACORNS application frame. 
The tabs contain the names of each file that is active. Clicking on the tabs enables you to switch which 
file you want to work with. Tabbed view contrasts with 
the <a href="FullViewWindows.htm">Full View</a>. Full View is the default way that ACORNS displays 
lesson data.</p>
