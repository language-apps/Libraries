<p>Copy and Paste are options on the edit menu. These commands enable you to copy lessons from one file to another. The 
shortcut keys (^c and ^v) are standard across many applications. The copy command copies the currently active lesson to an 
ACORNS clipboard. If you then switch to another file, using the window menu, you can then paste the lesson into another file. 
These commands can be useful because they minimize the times where a lesson needs to be recreated from scratch in another file 
of ACORNS lessons.</p>
<p>Copy and Paste can also be used to change a lesson of one type to another of the same category. For example, you can copy
a multiple choice lesson and paste it as a flash card lesson. This can save lots of work because you won't have to reenter
all of the pictures, audio, and text.</p>
