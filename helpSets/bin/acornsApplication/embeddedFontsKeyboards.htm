	<p>	Some tribes require custom fonts and/or keyboard layouts to properly reflect their
		individual writing systems. ACORNS can embed these custom fonts and keyboard layouts
		into lessons distributed on CDs or those posted to the Web. This feature facilitates 
		their use by language students that don't have the technical expertise to install 
		those fonts or keyboard layouts onto their systems.</p>
		 
	<p>The folder Documents/acornsFiles contains sub-directories to hold custom
		fonts and keyboard layouts. If the acornsFiles directory doesn't exist, the Acorns directory is used
		instead. Within this folder, custom fonts and keyboard layouts are stored
		within the Fonts and keyLayoutFiles folders respectively.</p>
	
	<p>Any True Type Font (with a <i>.ttf</i> extension) that you want included within the 
	    Web-jar file created when you make a Web-page out of an ACORNS file should be stored 
		in the Fonts subfolder. Acorns does the rest 
		automatically. Any lesson that requires these fonts, even if students don't install 
		them on their local systems.</p>
