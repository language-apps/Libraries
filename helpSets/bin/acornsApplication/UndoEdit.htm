<h1 align="center"><b>Undo Command</b></h1>

<p>The undo command is an option on the edit menu. It also appears as an icon on the toolbar. This option becomes available 
when certain modifications to lesson data take place. Otherwise the toolbar button and the menu selection option appear 
faded (ghosted). </p>

<p>Undo's purpose is to cancel a command that has altered lesson data in a way that is undesirable. For example, picture and 
sound lessons allow you to restore sound data that was inadvertantly changed or deleted. To execute the undo command, simply 
click on the undo button.</p>

<p>Many word processors have redo and undo commands. These commands work in a similar way.</p>
