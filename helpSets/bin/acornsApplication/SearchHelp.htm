<h1 align="center"><b>Help Search</b></h1>

<p>When you execute the Help command, three tabs show on the left side of the display. One of these tabs has the label 
'Search'. If you select this option, you can search for a term in the help database by entering your search criteria. The 
help system then displays a list of all matching pages.</p> 

<p>If you click on one of the bulleted items, the help system displays detailed information in the right panel of the Help 
Screen.  The search option operates similar to the way that web-based search engines work.</p>

<p>For more generalized information about help refer to the <a href="OverviewHelp.htm">Help Overview</a></p>.
