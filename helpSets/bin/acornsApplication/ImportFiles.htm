<p>The import command executes when you choose the import option from the file menu. You can also click 
on the <image src="data/import.png"> icon on the toolbar with a left arrow. </p>

<p>Import is similar to an open operation, but it loads lesson information that was previously exported using 
XML format. It also saves sound clips and images using industry standard formats such as JPEG and WAV. 
Export capabilities are the 'best practice' approach to archive linguistics data because data is not subject to 
obsolescence because of software that developers no longer support.</p>

<p>When the import option runs, an dialog frame appears. This gives you the chance to select a file name for 
the import. The command automatically recognizes the formats of the sound and image files.</p>

<p>Refer to <a href="ExportFiles.htm">Export Files</a> for more details describing the export command. 
Use export and import for files that you want to archive for long term use.</p>

<h3 align="center">Additional Notes</h3>

<p>You can use the exported sound clips and images in other ACORNS lessons or in other application programs. 
The export command writes data to a file name with an 'xml' extension (e.g. 'landscape.xml'). The images and 
sound clips save in a folder whose name is the same, but without the extension (e.g. 'landscape'). Don't 
change the file names in that directory, or the ACORNS import command will not work correctly.</p>

<p>Note that you can copy the image and sound files to other folders and name them as you wish.</p>
