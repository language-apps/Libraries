<h1 align="center"><b>Insert Image</b></h1>

<p>The insert image command executes when you click on the edit menu and then select the image option 
from the insert submenu. It also runs when you click its icon <img align="center" src="data/image.png"> on the 
toolbar. Use this command to insert or replace an image in a lesson. 

When you execute this command, a file dialog frame will appear. This frame allows you to find and select 
the image to insert. ACORNS remembers the folder housing the image that was retrieved last. This feature 
eliminates unnecessary traversing through system folders to find image files.

<h3 align="center">Additional Notes</h3>

<ul>
<li>Picture and Sound lessons have only one image; other lesson types may require more than one. For example, 
multiple choice lessons require at least four pictures. Hear and click lessons enable you to attach a series of 
pictures to an audio story.</li>
<li>You can also insert pictures into lessons using a drag and drop mechanism. When you have an 
operating system folder open, select one or a group of pictures; next drag to the ACORNS application frame
and release the mouse. All of the pictures will insert into the lesson. (If the lesson only allows a single
picture, the last one selected will be the one used.)</li>
<li>Some lessons might have a button with a camera icon on the secondary toolbar. This button works the
same as just described; however, it allows the user to insert a background picture that will show when
the lesson executes.</li>
<li>The Insert Image command is available only when there is an active lesson corresponding to the current file. 
Otherwise the menu and toolbar options will appear faded (ghosted).</li>
</ul>
