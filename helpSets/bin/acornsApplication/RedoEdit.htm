<p>The redo command is an option on the edit menu. It also appears as an icon on the toolbar. This option becomes available 
when certain modifications to lesson data are undone using the undo command. Otherwise the toolbar button and the menu 
selection option appear faded (ghosted). To redo an operation, simply click on the redo button.</p>

<p>Many word processors have redo and undo commands. These commands work in a similar way.</p>
