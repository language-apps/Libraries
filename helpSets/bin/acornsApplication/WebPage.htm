<p>This option now links to the operation, which creates a
<a href="MobileWebPage.htm">Make Mobile Application</a>.

<p>Although this command was the traditional way that ACORNS 
created Web pages out of lessons, evolving mobile technology 
standards prevent these Web pages from executing on today's 
popular mobile tablets and phones. For security reasons, 
Desktop Web browsers also often block these pages without users
granting permission. For these reasons, we've replaced the 
original ACORNS command to make web pages with the more universal 
approach that conforms to current best practice standards.
