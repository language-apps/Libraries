<h1 align="center"><b>Print and Print Preview Commands</b></h1>

<p>These two commands will execute either by selecting options on the File menu or by clicking the 
corresponding icons on the toolbar. Most application programs use the same icons for these 
commands, <img src="data/print.png"> and <img src="data/printpreview.png">. 
Print preview allows you to see the output, using a variety of scale factors, before printing. The Print 
and Print Preview options allows you to select a printer should your system 
contain more than one. You can print all or part of the output by selecting a range of pages.</p>
