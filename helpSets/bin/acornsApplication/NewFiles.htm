<p>The new file command executes when you click the new option on the file menu. It also executes when you 
click the new icon on the tool bar (it looks like a blank sheet of paper). When you execute this command a 
new file is created.</p>
  
<p>The new file option can fail if too many files are currently open (active). If this occurs, 
you may close, save, or export one of the other open files, and then try again.</p>

<p>The new file command creates its own default name for the file (acorns.lnx). When you save the file, ACORNS will
use the title of the first lesson in the file, but you might want to rename it to something more
appropriate.</p>

<p>ACORNS will create new files in whichever folder houses file that was opened last. If no such folder 
exists, the New File command creates the folder in a folder called acornFiles in the user's home directory.</p>
