<h1 align="center">Setup for Lessons with Multiple Pictures</h1>

There is a common setup procedure for creating lessons containing multiple pictures. The setup
panel fills the right side of the ACORNS window application. On the top of the panel, there is a
secondary toolbar. <a href="#secondary">Click here</a> for a detailed description.

<h3>Step 1: Insert at least four pictures</h3>
You need to first insert at least four pictures and record audio into each image before you can execute (play) a lesson. 
One way to execute the insert image command is to click on the edit menu and then select the image option from 
the insert submenu. An easier way is to simply click <img align="center" src="setupControls/image.png" > on the ACORNS application
toolbar. A third way is to drag and drop; when you have an operating system folder open, select one or a group of pictures; 
next drag to the ACORNS application frame and release the mouse. All of the pictures will insert into the lesson. If you
choose to insert using the first two of these approaches, a file chooser dialog will appear, which is similar to
chooser menus that other application programs use. Browse to the folder containing the pictures, and then click on the
desired picture. Note that if the folder contains lots of pictures; it sometimes takes a while for the list of files
to display. After adding a picture to a lesson, you can add additional pictures by repeating the procedure just described.

<h4>Remove a picture</h4>
Should you want to remove a picture from the lesson, first click on the one that you want to delete. You will see its
border turn red as a result. Now you can remove the picture in two ways. The faster method is to click again on the picture 
and while the mouse is depressed, drag the mouse off the ACORNS application frame. When you release, the picture will be gone. There is also a longer way to do the same thing.
The other approach is to click on the edit menu, then click on remove, and then on image. The picture selected (with the red 
border showing) will be deleted from the lesson.

<h4>Reordering pictures</h4>
To reorder the pictures, first click on the one to be reordered to see its border turn red. Then depress your
mouse over the picture and drag to the desired position. When you release the mouse, the picture will be moved to the
nes position.
 
<h3>Step 2: Attach audio to each picture</h3>
<p>To execute a lesson, there must be at least one sound clip attached to each picture. You are not limited to one sound
clip, however. Any number of sound clips can be attached. First select a picture by clicking on it. This will cause its border
to turn red. A sound dialog will then appear which will enable you to attach audio to a picture, or modify what you did
previously. For more information, there is a help web-page called <a href="recordingAudio.htm">
Recording and Maintaining Audio.</a> that describes this procedure in more detail.</p>

<h3>Step 3: Execute the lesson</h3>
Once you have inserted at least four pictures and attached at least one audio to each picture, your lesson is ready to 
execute. To execute, click on the icon that looks like a lightning bolt (<img align="center" src="setupControls/run.png" >).

<h3>Note: Recovering from errors</h3>
If you make a mistake, ACORNS can help you recover. For example if you remove a picture inadvertantly,
click on the undo icon on the ACORNS toolbar at the top of the frame. The picture will return. The undo 
operation can also recover from changes made when you record sounds, and attach them to one of the
pictures. After undoing, the redo button becomes active. You can redo an operation if you change your mind. 

<h3 align="left"><a name="secondary"></a>Secondary toolbar options</h3>
At the top of the setup panel, there is a secondary toolbar as shown in the picture below. This toolbar contains a series of 
grapic components and we will describe the purpose of each.

<table align="center"><tr><td align="center"><img src="data/multiplePicturesToolbar.jpg" vspace="5"></td></tr></table>

<table border="1">
<tr><td><img src="setupControls/helpButton.jpg"></td><td>When you click the help button, this page displays.
	The title you gave to this lesson when it was created appears to the right of the help button</td></tr>

<tr><td><img src="setupControls/slider.jpg" align="left"></td><td>All ACORNS lessons can have multiple layers. This 
		feature can be useful to create lessons with multiple dialects. By switching between
		layers, the student can learn each dialects using the same lesson. This option can also be used to
		assign more difficult lessons to the higher layers. The slider
		on the control bar enables you to set up a lesson with multiple layers. Simply click
		on the slider to move to the desired layer. The layer numbers are numbered as shown on the picture
		to the left.</td></tr>

<tr><td><img src="setupControls/image.png" align="left" ></td><td>This control enables you to 
	insert a background picture to the lesson. This gives you more control as to how the lesson looks when
	it executes.</td></tr>

<tr><td><img src="setupControls/scale.jpg"></td><td>The drop down menu shows ways to scale a selected picture to its display area. 
 There are five ways to scale pictures.
       <ol>
          <li>Scale and center sizes the picture to the display area and centers it. There is no 
              distortion, but part of the display area can be blank.</li>
          <li>Fill with distortion stretches the picture to the display area. This option fills
              the entire display area, but the picture can appear distorted.</li>
          <li>Fill and truncate. This option fills the entire display area without distortion,
              but crops a piece out of the middle.</li>
          <li>Stretch vertical. This option stretches the picture vertically but leaves the
              width as is.</li>
          <li>Stretch horizontal. This option stretches the picture horizontally but leaves the
              height as is.</li>
       </ol>
		</td></tr>

<tr><td><img src="setupControls/rotate.png" align="left" ></td><td>The rotate button allows
       you to rotate the selected picture in ninety degree increments. This feature accommodates 
       pictures taken with the camera rotated. Click to select the picture, and then click the rotate
	   button.</td></tr>


<tr><td><img src="setupControls/fontControls.jpg" align="left" height="30"></td><td>These controls allow you to control
		background and text colors that are used when the lesson executes. If you click either of the two left buttons,t
		you will see a color palette display; simply click the color you want and then click OK. The button with the 
		capital A is for the text color and the one with the three boxes and hand is for the background color.</td></tr>
			
<tr><td><img src="data/copyPaste.jpg" align="left" ></td><td>
	In some cases you might want to move all of the recorded audio from one layer to another. The Copy
	and Paste Acorns buttons enable allows you to do this. Use these buttons
	as follows: (1) Move the slider to the layer containing the audio that you want to copy; (2) Click the copy button 
	(the one shown on the left); (3) Move the slider to the layer where you want to paste the acorns; and (4) Click the paste 
	button (the one on the right). Your recorded audio will be present in the new layer.<br><br>
	
<tr><td><img src="setupControls/anchor.png" align="left" ></td><td>
        The link button allows you to connect this lesson with another lesson in the file. Clicking on
        this button causes a dialog window to appear.
        Enter the name of the lesson you want to link to. The name field is one of the header fields
        that you fill in when you create a lesson. (You can modify it later if you didn't.) It shows in the lesson display 
		area on the left of the ACORNS application frame. After you click OK to the link dialog, the name of the
		linked lesson will show in blue on the secondary toolbar.</td></tr>
