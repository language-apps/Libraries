<h1 align=center>Executing Moving Pictures Lessons</h1>

<p>When you execute a Moving Pictures lesson, you will see four pictures moving about the frame. Every 
twenty or thirty seconds, one of the pictures change. At any time, you can click one of the pictures
to hear an audio recording relating to that picture. If the lesson has more than one
recording attached to the picture, the program will randomly choose among them. When you click, you will also
see the gloss (first language) translation and the indigenous spelling at the top of the page.</p>

<h3>Play Control Panel</h3>
<p>On the bottom of your display you will see a row of buttons that are standard across all lesson types. For more 
information <a href="../commonHelpSets/playControls.htm">Click Here</a>. Clicking on the middle button
(<img src="../commonHelpSets/playControls/info.png" > ) causes a pop up menu to appear, which has options that are unique for each
lesson type. Moving Picture lesson options are shown with explanations below.</p>
<br>
	<table border="1">
	  <tr><td>Turn sound off<br>Turn&nbsp;native&nbsp;spelling&nbsp;off<br>Turn translation off</td>
		  <td>
			Clicking on the selections to turn off sound, native spelling, or translation will cause the lesson to 
			respectively stop playing audio, showing the indigenous spelling, or the first language translation. After
			doing this, the next time you display the popup options, the words <em>off</em> will change to 
			<em>on</em> so you can restore the lesson to its initial state.
