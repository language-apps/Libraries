<h1 align="center"><b>Hear and Respond Lesson Setup</b></h1>
Hear and Respond setup requires an audio story (usually thirty seconds to a couple of minutes long), and text
annotations that attach to places within the story. These lessons are setup using the data panel on the right side of the 
ACORNS window frames. On the top of the panel, there is a secondary toolbar used to customize the lesson. 
<a href="#secondary">Click here</a> for a detailed description.

<h3>Step 1: Load your Story</h3>
If you are ready to record, follow the instructions on the <a href="../soundEditor/recording.html">Recording page</a>.
Otherwise,if you want to use pre-recorded audio, follow the instructions on the 
<a href="../soundEditor/loadSave.html">File Management</a> page.

<h3>Step 2: Attach your Annotations</h3>
After you load your story, you will see the sound represented by a wavy line. The first step is to select a piece of the 
audio, to which you will attach a text annotation.

<h4>Selecting a portion of a sound recording</h4>

The buttons around the sound panel provide limited sound editing capabilities. Many of these work
by first selecting the portion of interest. This procedure is used consistently in this program, 
so it is a good idea to get familiar with how it is done. First, depress your mouse at a starting point and drag is over the 
desired portion of a recording. If you click the play back button (<img src="../soundEditor/soundControls/play.png" valign="middle" >) 
you will hear the audio corresponding to the section of the sound wave that you select.

<p>The picture below shows a portion of the panel that is selected. Notice that the highlighted area is
shaded. If you click the mouse again the selection is released.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="data/annotationSelection.jpg"></p> 

<p>Use the select and play technique to find a word that you want to annotate. Type the text in the text field at the
bottom of the sound panel and then click the add icon (<img src="../soundEditor/soundControls/add.png" valign="middle">) and the annotation
will appear. If you want to modify the text, click within the annotatation area; the current annotaion text then will display 
in the text field. Modify it as you with and then click on the edit icon (<img src="../soundEditor/soundControls/edit.png" valign="middle">).
To delete one or more annotations, select a portion of the sound that contains the annotations you want to delete and then
click on the delete icon (<img src="../soundEditor/soundControls/garbage.png">). Using these commands will enable you to annotate the entire story
with the corresponding words that apply. This procedure is described in more detail in the 
<a href="../soundEditor/annotationControls.html">Annotation Controls</a> page. 

<h3>Step 4: Execute the lesson</h3>
Once you have loaded your audio and annotated it with a translation, you are ready to execute the lesson.
To execute, click on the icon that looks like a lightning bolt (<img align="center" src="../commonHelpSets/setupControls/run.png" >).


<h2 align="center">Annotation Panel Buttons and Controls</h2>
      while annotating, if you make a mistake, error messages display in red at the bottom of the panel. Sometimes 
      ACORNS acknowledges what it is doing by displaying a message in this area. The 
      <a href="../soundEditor/errors.html">Errors</a> page describes the kind of messages that can display. 
      <br><br>
      While you are setting up a Story Book lesson, there are a series of buttons to assist. 
	  As you move your mouse over the various buttons, you will see a short description of the component. This can help if 
	  you forget what a particular component does. We have help pages that describe the operation of of the 
      various buttons. You can click on the image links below to learn how these buttons and controls work.

<h3>Note: Recovering from errors</h3>
If you make a mistake, ACORNS can help you recover. For example if you inadvertantly delete part of an audio,
click on the undo icon on the ACORNS toolbar. The deleted portion will return. The undo 
operation can also recover from changes you make. After undoing, the redo button becomes active. You can 
redo an operation if you change your mind and want the change to take effect after all. 

<h3 align="left"><a name="secondary"></a>Secondary toolbar options</h3>
At the top of the setup panel, there is a secondary toolbar as shown in the picture below. This toolbar contains a series of 
grapic components and we will describe the purpose of each.

<table align="center"><tr><td align="center"><img src="data/toolbar.jpg" vspace="5"></td></tr></table>

<table border="1">
	<tr><td><img src="../commonHelpSets/setupControls/helpButton.jpg"></td><td>When you click the help button, this page displays.
	The title you gave to this lesson when it was created appears to the right of the help button</td></tr>

	<tr><td><img src="../commonHelpSets/setupControls/slider.jpg" align="left"></td><td>All ACORNS lessons can have multiple layers; each
	Story Book lesson layer has separate translation. This 
	feature can be useful to create lessons with multiple dialects. By switching between
	layers, the student can learn each dialects using the same lesson. The slider
	on the control bar enables you to set up a lesson with multiple layers. Simply click
	on the slider to move to the desired layer. The layer numbers are numbered as shown on the picture
	to the left.</td></tr>

	<tr><td><img src="../commonHelpSets/setupControls/image.png" align="left" ></td><td>This control enables you to 
	insert a background picture to the lesson. This gives you more control as to how the lesson looks when
	it executes.</td></tr>

	<tr><td><img src="../commonHelpSets/setupControls/fontControls.jpg" align="left"></td><td>These controls allow you to control
	background and text colors that are used when the lesson executes. If you click either of the two left buttons, 
	you will see a color palette display; simply click the color you want and then click OK. The button with the 
	capital A is for the text color and the one with the three boxes and hand is for the background color.</td></tr>

	<tr><td><img src="../commonHelpSets/setupControls/fontSize.jpg" align="left" ></td><td>The font size drop down menu enables

	selection or enter your own. </td></tr>

<tr><td><image src="../commonHelpSets/setupControls/justifyButtons.jpg" ></td><td>
	The justify buttons enable you to ether center or left justify the text while the story plays. By default
	the text is left justified. When you click on one of these buttons it will display depressed to indicate
	that the option is active. The justification applies to a active lesson layer.<br><br> 
		
<tr><td><img src="../commonHelpSets/setupControls/anchor.png" align="left"></td><td>
	The link button allows you to connect this lesson with another lesson in the file. Clicking on
	this button causes a dialog window to appear.
	Enter the name of the lesson you want to link to. The name field is one of the header fields
	that you fill in when you create a lesson. (You can modify it later if you didn't.) It shows in the lesson display 
	area on the left of the ACORNS application frame. After you click OK to the link dialog, the name of the
	linked lesson will show in blue on the secondary toolbar.</td></tr>
