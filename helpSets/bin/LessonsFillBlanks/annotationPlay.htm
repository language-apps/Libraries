<h1 align="center"><b>Executing a Hear and Respond Lesson</b></h1>

<p>When you execute a hear and respond lesson, you will see the text of a particular recording
but with some words blank. The program will play back the recording, highlighting the annotated words as 
it goes, and stopping after reaching the first blank word.
Your job is then to type in the correct word (or phrase). When you hit the enter key, there are three 
possibilities that we now list. </p>

<ol>
<li>If correct, you will hear an acknowledgment sound, and the program will continue to the
next blank word.</li>
<li>If you are close, perhaps because of a spelling error, you will hear a different sound, and the 
program will repeat the play back.</li>
<li>If you are way off, the program will output a third sound, and the program will repeat the playback.
</li>
</ol>

<p>
The score in the upper right corner will show how you are doing. You continue filling in the blanks
until the program gets to the end of the recording. For long recordings, you will see the display change
at the end of each page. After the lesson completes, the process will start all over again, this time
with a different set of blanks.
</p>

<p>At the top of the display, there are icon buttons that can help.
If you want to replay the last part of the recording again simply
click (or touch) the replay button.
Similarly, the button with the blue circle is for showing the correct answer.
There is also a button to pause the audio and another button, play, to
continue the play back to the next pause point. Finally, click the check button to
verify your answer. You can also verify your answer by pressing the enter key
on your keyboard.</p>

<h3>Play Control Panel</h3>
<p>On the bottom of your display you will see a row of buttons that are standard across all lesson types. For more 
information <a href="/commonHelpSets/playControls.htm">Click Here</a>. Clicking on the middle button
(<img src="/commonHelpSets/playControls/info.png">) causes a pop up menu to appear, which has options that are unique for each
lesson type.Hear and Respond lesson options are shown with explanations below.</p>

		    The first option resets the game, which means starting the story with different blank words<br><br>
			Clicking on the next option toggles between Continuous and non-Continuous playback mode. The standard way that
			the lesson operates is in non-continulus mode. Continuous playback mode plays the story straight through
			highlighting the words as they go by.<br><br>
			The difficulty level option controls how many blank words will appear.<br><br>
			The font size selections allows you to adjust the size of the displayed story text to show larger or smaller.
