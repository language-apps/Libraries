<h1 align="center"><b>Executing a Hear and Respond Lesson</b></h1>

<p>When you execute a hear and respond lesson, you will see the text of a particular recording
but with some words blank. The program will play back the recording, highlighting the annotated words as 
it goes, and stopping after reaching the first blank word.
Your job is then to type in the correct word (or phrase). When you hit the enter key, there are three 
possibilities that we now list. </p>

<ol>
<li>If correct, you will hear an acknowledgment sound, and the program will continue to the
next blank word.</li>
<li>If you are close, perhaps because of a spelling error, you will hear a different sound, and the 
program will repeat the play back.</li>
<li>If you are way off, the program will output a third sound, and the program will repeat the play back.
</li>
</ol>

<p>
The score in the upper right corner will show how you are doing. You continue filling in the blanks
until the program gets to the end of the recording. For long recordings, you will see the display change
at the end of each page. After the lesson completes, the process will start all over again, this time
with a different set of missing words.
</p>

<p>
To make the process more enjoyable, there are several icon buttons. Simply click (or touch) the appropriate 
icon to hear the play back of the missing word, see the correct answer, pause the play back in the middle,
continue onto the next missing word, or check your answer.
</p>

<p>
<p>The three recording icons allow students to answer
verbally, rather than typing the answer. Simply,
say the answer and then click the check mark. The program
will attempt to verify the accuracy of the response. This
option works within the ACORNS application, but not within
browser applications. Within the Android player application,
you will not see the record buttons; but can use those that
appear at the bottom of the display window. Language independent
speech recognition is a difficult task for computers, so we
are still attempting to improve the accuracy of this option.

<h3>Play Control Panel</h3>
<p>On the bottom of your display you will see a row of buttons that are standard across all lesson types. For more 
information <a href="../commonHelpSets/playControls.htm">Click Here</a>. Clicking on the middle button
(<img src="../commonHelpSets/playControls/info.png">) causes a pop up menu to appear, which has options that are unique for each
lesson type.Hear and Respond lesson options are shown with explanations below.</p>

		    The first option resets the game, which means starting the story with different blank words<br><br>
			Clicking on the next option toggles between Continuous and non-Continuous playback mode. The standard way that
			the lesson operates is in non-continulus mode. Continuous playback mode plays the story straight through
			highlighting the words as they go by.<br><br>
			The difficulty level option controls how many blank words will appear.<br><br>
			The font size selections allows you to adjust the size of the displayed story text to show larger or smaller.
