<h1 align="center"><b>Introduction to Translate Lessons</b></h1>

<p>A Translate lesson first configures a set of categories (like travel, interests, food, etc.) that will be used in the
lesson. For each category, a fluent speaker enters the name of the category, records an appropriate audio, and possibly 
adds a picture. The next step is to enter a set of sentences that apply to each category configured in the first step. This 
includes audio recordings of sentences, gloss language translations, the corresponding indigenous 
spellings, and possibly pictures along with some additional descriptive information.</p>

<p>When the lesson executes, the student will contruct sentences that they hear, one-by-one. When finished they will have 
the option to repeat the category or to move onto the next. A running score provides the student with feedback to show how 
they are doing.</p>

<p>Translate lesson creation proceeds in two steps. 
The first step is to configure and set up the data appropriately. 
Refer to <a href="../commonHelpSets/relatedPhrasesSetup.htm">Related Phrase Lesson Setup</a> for more details.  
The second step is to execute the lesson and we describe this process in the 
<a href="translatePlay.htm">Translate Lesson Execute</a> page.
This procedure is analogous to setting up Power Point slides and then running a slide show.</p>
