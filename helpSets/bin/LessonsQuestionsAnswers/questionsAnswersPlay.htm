<h1 align=center>Executing Question and Answer lessons</h1>

<p>The purpose of Question and Answer lessons is for a fluent speaker to ask a question, which generates a 
response; hopefully an appropriate answer. The questions are grouped into panels representing, which display about 
the window. </p>

<p>To hear a question, one clicks the play button at the top of one of the panels. Students then attempt to
 properly answer the question, either verbally, or by typing the answer into the text field near the 
 bottom of the panel. A verbal response is possible using the record, play, and playback icons.</p>

<p>There is an icon with a green check mark on the bottom right. Clicking this icon verifies the answer; the 
program will give appropriate feedback indicating if the response is correct, incorrect, or way off. Students
can discover an appropriate answer by clicking on the panel's blue icon containing a white question mark. Another
panel will pop up containing gloss and indigenous text, along with a play button to hear a correct answer.</p>

<p>The three recording icons allow students to answer
questions verbally, rather than typing the answer. Simply,
say the answer and then click the check mark. The program
will attempt to verify the accuracy of the response. This
option works within the ACORNS application, but not within
desktop-based browsers. On the Android player application,
you will not see the record buttons; but can use those that
appear at the bottom of the display window. Language independent
speech recognition is a difficult task for computers, so we
are still attempting to improve the accuracy of this option.

<h3>Play Control Panel</h3>
<p>On the bottom of your display there is a row of buttons that are standard across all lesson types. For more 
information <a href="/commonHelpSets/playControls.htm">Click Here</a>. Clicking on the middle button
(<img src="/commonHelpSets/playControls/info.png">) causes a pop up menu to appear, which has options 
that are unique for each lesson type. Question and Answer lesson options are shown with explanations below.</p>
<br>
	<table border="1">
	  <tr><td>Reset game</td>

			Clicking on this selection resets the game by redisplaying a different set of questions at random 
			positions on the display to start over.
		  </td>
	   </tr><td>Increase difficulty level<br >Decrease&nbsp;difficulty&nbsp;level</td>
	       <td>This option allows the student to adjust the difficulty of the lesson. A higher difficulty level means that more
		   questions will show on the frame. Similarly, a lower difficulty level means that less questions will
		   display.
