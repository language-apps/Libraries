<h1 align=center>Executing Story Book Lessons</h1>

<p>When you execute a Story Book, you will see a picture at the top that relates to the audio story
contained in the lesson. You will also see a series of control buttons near the bottom of the picture.
These operate in accordance with the following list.</p>
<br>
<table border="1">
<tr><td align="center">Replay</td><td>This button rewinds the recording at the same speed at which it 
played. This is useful if you want to back up the recording to rehear a word or a phrase.</td></tr>
<tr><td align="center">Pause</td><td>This button pauses the recording at the current place. It is used in
connection with the rewind button.</td></tr>
<tr><td align="center">Stop</td><td>This button stops the recording and goes back to the beginning. This is
useful if you want to replay the recording from the beginning.</td></tr>
<tr><td align="center">Play</td><td>The button starts the playing of the audio story. As it plays
the word in the story that is playing will highlight. Note though, that this is only
a rough estimate because setup mode did not require you to select the exact spot where the
words appeared in the sound wave.</td></tr>
</table>

<h3>Play Control Panel</h3>
<p>On the bottom of your display you will see a row of buttons that are standard across all lesson types. For more 
information <a href="../commonHelpSets/playControls.htm">Click Here</a>. Clicking on the middle button
(<img src="../commonHelpSets/playControls/info.png">) causes a pop up menu to appear, which has options that are unique for each
lesson type. Story Book lesson options are shown with explanations below.</p>
<br>
	<table border="1"><tr>
		<td>Increase&nbsp;Font&nbsp;Size&nbsp;from&nbsp;20<br>
	        Decrease&nbsp;Font&nbsp;Size&nbsp;from&nbsp;20</td>
		<td>
		You can select either of the top two options to respectively adjust the font size to be 10% larger or smaller. 
		The current size of the font in points displays (20 on the left).
		</td>
	</tr>
