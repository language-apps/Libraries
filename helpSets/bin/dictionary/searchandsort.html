<p>The above pictures show the controls that you can use to search or sort a dictionary. The icon at the left appears
on the west wall of the WOLF application frame. Simply click on that icon, and WOLF will sort the dictionary alphabetically.
For languages that require a custom sort orders, please refer to the <a href="gettingstarted.html">language entry</a> page.</p>

<p>On the right of the above picture, there is a label shown containing a <strong>W</strong> character. Clicking on this label 
will change the <strong>W</strong> to a <strong>C</strong>. Clicking again changes the label to display an <strong>O</strong> 
character. Another click causes the label to revert to the initial <strong>W</strong> character. The purpose of this label is 
to control the type of searching that you desire. <strong>W</strong> stands for a word search, <strong>C</strong> stands for a 
category search, and <strong>O</strong> stands for an ontology search. For example if you want to find all of the past tense 
words in your dictionary, do an ontology search using the GOLD term <i>past</i>.</p>

<p>To start a search, type the term you want in the text field to the left of the label and tap the keyboard <em>enter</em> key. 
Searching allows for wild card entry. For example, searching for <em>w*</em> will find all the words in the dictionary starting 
with the letter, <em>w</em>. The <em>*</em> serves as a wild card for any number of characters. Similarly, the <em>?</em> 
character wild cards a single character. Actually, the search field allows for much more powerful capabilities. If you understand 
regular expressions, it supports almost all regular expressions with a couple of minor differences. Searches are not 
case-sensitive. (<em>w*</em> will find the same words as <em>W*</em>). Also, if you enter a <em>*</em> or a <em>?</em>, WOLF will 
insert a period for you (if you didn't already do that). This is an accommodation for users that do not have a background with
using regular expressions. Although it slightly reduces the searching capabilities, it makes life easier for those users.</p>

<p>At the left of the above picture are three buttons, which work similar to back, forward, and refresh buttons that
exist in most Web browsers. Each search refines the words contained in a previous search. After a search, you can 
click <em>back</em> to have WOLF display the words shown prior to the search. 
The forward button restores the search, should you wish to do that. The back and forward buttons are ghosted until 
you do your first search (note how they show in the above picture). The refresh button reloads the entire 
dictionary in its initial state.
