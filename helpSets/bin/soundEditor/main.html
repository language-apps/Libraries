      The ACORNS Sound Editor has three sections that display when it executes. At the top of the
      display is a control panel that contains two sliders and check boxes, and two buttons. A picture
      of this panel follows.

      <br><br>
      The slider and checkbox on the left control the computer speaker output. The slider and
      checkbox on the right control microphone input. Drag the sliders to adjust the volume 
      of the input and/or output. Dragging to the left decreases the volume; dragging to the right 
      increases the volume. The mute check box, if checked, indicates that the output to the speaker 
      is disabled (muted). Check this box to reenable the output. The boost check box indicates 
      whether recordings will amplify (boost) the microphone input signal. It is a good idea for the 
      boost to be active when working with sound 
      recordings. Note that these controls are not present on MAC systems.
      <br><br>
	  There are three buttons on the ACORNS control pannel, one to the left and two to the right. 
      Clicking a button triggers the program to perform the desired function. The button on the
      left triggers the ACORNS help option.The page you are reading is part of the help facilities 
      offered. Click on <a href="help.html"><img align="middle" src="soundControls/help.png" ></a> to learn more
      about the help option.

      <br><br>The first button on the right (<img valign="center" src="soundControls/flip.png">) toggles the mode 
      of operation between sound editing and
      annotation. Sound editing is that standard way we manipulate and edit sound recordings. In editing
      mode the program displays
      two identical sound panels. Refer to the <a href="soundPanel.html">sound panel</a> web page for 
      more information about how to work a sound panel. Annotation mode allows you to attach text 
      annotations to portions of a sound recording. Refer to the <a href="annotationPanel.htm">annotation
      panel</a> web page for instructions regarding this mode.

      <br><br>
      The button on the far right triggers an option dialog that enables you to configure the advanced 
      controls that are available. This option makes sense if you are familiar with digital signal
      processing. Otherwise you can leave the options set as is. Click on      
      <a href="controls.html"><img align="middle" src="soundControls/options.png" ></a> to learn more 
      about the advanced control features.
      <br><br>
      As we just mentioned, in editing mode, there are identical sound panels that show on the bottom 
      part of the application frame. These panels allow you to enter and edit sound recordings. You can 
      use one of these as a work area as you use the various cut, paste, and edit options. The picture of 
      one of these panels follow. Click on the <a href="soundPanel.html">Acorns Sound Panel</a> page for 
      more information on how use these panels.
