      <h2 align="center">Sound and Annotation Panel File Edit Buttons</h2>
      <p>
      The edit control buttons allow you to alter sound recordings that you see in a 
      wave display window at the center of a sound panel. These buttons are most effective
      if you first select a portion of the displayed sound wave. To do this, first press the mouse
      at the starting position in the display window. Then holding the pressed down position, drag 
      your mouse to the ending position. Then release. You should see the portion that you selected
      highlighted in the wave display window. The edit commands apply to the portion of the sound
      display that you select.
      </p>
      If you make a mistake you can undo what you did. Refer to the <a href="redoUndo.html">Redo/Undo</a> 
      page for details.

      <tr>
         <td valign="top">Copy&nbsp;<img align="middle" src="soundControls/copy.png" ></td>
         <td>
            Pressing this button copies the selected portion of the sound wave to the ACORNS
            sound editor clipboard. Refer to the paste command for what comes next.
         </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
         <td valign="top">Cut&nbsp;<img align="middle" src="soundControls/cut.png" ></td>
         <td>
           Pressing this button deletes the selected portion of the sound wave. However, the deleted
           portion is transferred to the ACORNS sound editor clipboard. Refer to the paste command for
           what comes next.
         </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
         <td valign="top">Paste&nbsp;<img align="middle" src="soundControls/paste.png" ></td>
         <td>
           To paste the sound contained in the ACORNS sound editor clipboard, first click the mouse
           at the postition in a sound wave display window where you want the clipboard sound to 
           insert. This can be in either of the two sound panels that display in the main sound
           editor application. When you press the paste button, the sound saved in the clipbard
           will insert into the wave. The display will show the modified wave. Note that after you
           paste, the clipbard still retains the sound as well. This allows you to perform multiple
           paste operations with the same sound clip. 
         </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
         <td valign="top">Delete&nbsp;<img align="middle" src="soundControls/delete.png" ></td>
         <td>
           The delete button works just like cut, except that the deleted portion does not go to
           the Sound Editor clipboard.
         </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
         <td valign="top">Duplicate&nbsp;<img align="middle" src="soundControls/duplicate.png" ></td>
         <td>
         When you press the duplicate button, the selected portion of the sound wave is inserted
         immediately after the selection. When you play back, you will hear the sound twice.
         </td>
      </tr>       
      <tr>
         <td valign="top">Trim&nbsp;<img align="middle" src="soundControls/trim.png" ></td>
         <td>
         The trim button silences everything outside of your selection. This command is useful
         to eliminate clicks and background noise that playes before and after the recording.
         </td>
      </tr>       
      <tr>
         <td valign="top">Silence&nbsp;<img align="middle" src="soundControls/silence.png" ></td>
         <td>
         The silence button silences everything inside of your selection. This command can be useful
         if you hear background static or noise between words.
         </td>
      </tr>       
      <tr>
         <td valign="top">Filter&nbsp;<img align="middle" src="soundControls/filter.png" ></td>
         <td>
         The filter button applies one of ACORNS filter algorithms to the audio signal. There is a parameter in
		 the Sound Editor option panel that controls which filtering algorithm is used.
         </td>
