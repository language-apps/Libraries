      <h2 align="center">Sound and Annotation Panel File Control Buttons</h2>
      <p>
      The file control buttons allow you to load and save previously recorded sound files.
      </p>
      <table align="center" border="1">
      <tr>
         <td align="top">Erase&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img align="middle" src="soundControls/reset.png" ></td>
         <td>
            This button clears the sound that displays in the sound panel window.
         </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
         <td valign="top">Browse<img align="middle" src="soundControls/browse.png" ></td>
         <td>
            You use the browse button to look for a sound file stored on your disk. When you click
            on this button, a file dialog frame will appear. Click on the drop down menu to navigate
            to the folder that contains the desired file. The ACORNS sound editor will remember the
            path to this folder the next time you decide to load a recorded sound. This method of 
            file navigation is consistent with how other windows-based applications execute.
            <p>
            Once you navigate to the correct folder, you can type the name of the file that you want.
            You can also double click on the file name you want. It's name should show in the center 
            window of the file dialog frame. If you change your mind, click on the cancel button.
            </p> 
			<p>You can also use a drag and drop facility to load pre-recorded sounds. First open the operating system
			folder containing your audio files. Then press the mouse over the desired audio file, drag over the sound panel, 
			and when you see a small white rectangle show under the mouse, release. The audio will load into the sound panel.

         <td valign="top">Import&nbsp;&nbsp;<img align="middle" src="soundControls/import.png" ></td>
         <td>
            The import button works the same way as does the browse button described above. The 
            difference is that you can import both the sound file and the annotations  that you
            previously saved using the export button. See the 
            <a href="annotations.html">annotation</a> page for details. 
            <p>
            Standard sound file formats do not include annotations.The import option looks for an
            additional text file with an .xml extension that contains the annotations. This text
            format conforms to best practice procedures for dealing with linguistic data because
            text files are a standard format that is not proprietary. Programmers can easily write programs to access 
            and  manipulate the data.
            </p>
         </td>
      </tr><tr>
         <td valign="top">Export&nbsp;&nbsp;<img align="middle" src="soundControls/export.png" ></td>
         <td>
            When you click on the export button, a file save dialog frame appears. This dialog frame
            allows you to pick the file format you want and lets you navigate to the folder
            where you want to store your sound file.
            <p>
            The export operation displays a series of radio buttons. Click on the button that
            indicates which sound format type you want to use.The default is 
            <strong><em>wav</em></strong> since this is the most commonly used format.
            </p><p>
            Use this frame to navigate to the folder where you want to store your sound files. The 
            ACORNS sound editor will remember the path to this folder the next time you decide to 
            export a recorded sound. This method of file navigation is consistent with how other 
            windows-based applications execute.
            </p><p>
            After navigating to the appropriate file folder, you can type the name you want to use.
            You can also double click on one of the files displayed in the center window of the 
            save dialog frame. You will get a warning message if you
            attempt to replace an existing file. Press the confirm button to replace the file with
            the recorded sound your working with. Press cancel if you would rather not go ahead with
            the export operation.
            </p><p>
            The export option saves files along with any annotations that you enter. See the
            <a href="annotations.html">annotation</a> page for details. As a result, the ACORNS
            Sound Editor creates two files. One of the files is in a standard format for sound files.
            The other files is a text file with an .xml extension containing the annotations.This
            conforms to best practice procedures for dealing with linguistic data. Text files are
            a standard format that is not proprietary.  Programmers can easily write programs to 
            access and  manipulate the data.

         <td>
            This button is works like the export operation described above. The difference is the
            annotations that you enter will not be saved. Standard sound file formats do not
            include annotation data. See the <a href="annotations.html">annotation</a> page for 
            details.
