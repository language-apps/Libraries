<h1 align=center>Executing Missing Word lessons</h1>

<p>Missing Word lessons playback indigenous audios and then require the student to enter a missing word from the
sentence that they hear. These lessons group various sentences into particular categories (like food, travel, interests, 
etc.). The student responds to each sentence, one-by-one. When finished they will have the option to repeat the category 
or to move onto the next. A running score provides the student with feedback to show how they are doing.
</p>

<p>
For each sentence of a category, the student hears an audio and sees the display of the sentence with a randomly
chosen word missing. Their job is to type in the missing word. Buttons on the bottom of the display can be clicked 
(or touched) to insert language accents in case the indigenous keyboard is not set up.
</p>

<p>There are a set of buttons at the top left of the display. These respectively are used to repeat the playback,
to slow down the audio for eaier comprehension, to see the answer, and to check the answer. When the answer is checked,
the student will be provided with feedback as to whether it is correct. If incorrect, one can
proceed normaly, or skip the question. When the answer is nearly correct, or only different by accent characters, the 
answer is shown, but it will be counted as correct. After all questions in a category are handled, one can repeat working with the
current category, or they can move onto the next. A running score of correct versus incorrect answers also 
displays.
