<h1 align="center"><b>Introduction to Story Book Lessons</b></h1>

<p>Story Book lessons consist of an audio story, a picture to describe part of that story, and a
translation. By creating a series of these lessons and linking them together, you can
create a story book. The student listens as the story plays and translation words are highlighted during
the playback. Controls exist so students can pause, rewind, and play agin. </p>

<p>Story Book lessons are created in two steps. The first step configures and sets up the data appropriately. 
Refer to <a href="storySetup.htm">Story Book Setup</a> for more details.  
The second step is to execute the lesson as we describe in the
<a href="storyPlay.htm">Story Book Execution</a> page. 
This procedure is analogous to setting up Power Point slides and then running a slide show.</p>
<p>The Story Book setup panel allows some limited audio editing capabilities. If you need
to edit your recording more substantially, refer to the Sound Editor help pages.</p>
