      <p>At the bottom of an executing lesson is a series of standard control buttons
         as shown in the picture below. The table that follows the picture describes the purpose of each 
         of these buttons.</p>

         Pressing this button will move to the next higher layer. ACORNS layers can be setup for many
		 reasons. For example, they can represent different dialects or difficulty levels. 
		 If a lesson only has one layer, this button will have no effect.
