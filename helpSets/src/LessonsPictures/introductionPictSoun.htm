<h1 align="center"><b>Introduction to Picture and Sound Lessons</b></h1>

<p>Picture and sound lessons are those where audio can attach to places on the picture. 
When executing one of these lessons, by mouse clicks, you hear audio that relates to objects on the picture. 
You will also see the translation of the audio and the native spelling corresponding to the pronunciation. 
Audio, translation, and spelling are options that can be set to on or off. Multiple recordings can be tied to a 
single place on the picture, in which case ACORNS will randomly choose among them when they play back.
</p>

<p>Lessons can be linked together using mouse clicks. For example, a picture of a person can link to a 
picture of his arm. Each click can show a picture containing more detail. This is one use of links; 
there are many others. These links work like hyperlinks on the Web.</p>

<p>Picture and Sound Lessons (indeed all ACORNS lesson types) can store up to ten layers of data. 
These layers can allow for language teachers to record audio for multiple dialects. They can also enable the 
same lesson to be used by students having different fluency abilities.</p>

<p>Creation of Picture and Sound Lessons proceed in two steps. The first step is to configure and set up the 
data appropriately. Refer to <a href="picturesSetup.htm">Picture and Sound Setup</a> for more details.
The second step is to execute the lesson as we describe in <a href="picturesPlay.htm">Picture and Sound 
Execution</a>. This procedure is analogous to setting up Power Point slides and then running a Slide Show.</p>
