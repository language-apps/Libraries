<h1 align="center"><b>Picture and Sound Lesson Setup</b></h1>

Picture and sound lessons are setup using the data panel on the right side of the ACORNS window 
frames. On the top of the panel, there is a secondary toolbar used to customize the lesson. 
<a href="#secondary">Click here</a> for a detailed description.

<h3>Step 1: Insert a picture</h3>
You need to first insert a picture before you can execute (play) a lesson. 
One way to execute the insert image command is to click on the edit menu and then select the image option from 
the insert submenu. An easier way is to simply click <img align="center" src="../commonHelpSets/setupControls/image.png" > on the ACORNS application
toolbar. A third way is to drag and drop; when you have an operating system folder open, select a picture; 
next drag to the ACORNS application frame and release the mouse. The picture will insert into the lesson. If you
choose to insert using the first two of these approaches, a file chooser dialog will appear, which is similar to
chooser menus that other application programs use. Browse to the folder containing the pictures, and then click on the
desired picture. Note that if the folder contains lots of pictures; it sometimes takes a while for the list of files
to display. 

<h4>Remove a picture</h4>
Click on the edit menu, then click on remove, and then on image. The picture will be deleted from the lesson. Of course,
if you want to change the picture, you can just repeat the insert procedure. (there is no need to first remove the old one.)

<h3>Step 2: Attach audio to places on the picture</h3>
Pick a place on the picture that contains something that you want to describe and click on that spot. A dialog will 
appear which will enable you to record or to retrieve a prerecorded audio file. For more information, there is a help 
web-page called <a href="../commonHelpSets/recordingAudio.htm"> Recording and Maintaining Audio</a> that describes this procedure 
in more detail. After you complete this process, you will see an acorn icon appear at the spot you clicked.

<h4>Remove or adjust an acorn</h4>
You can adjust the position of an acorn by dragging it. Simply click on the acorn and while the mouse is
depressed, drag to the desired position. When you release, the acorn will be in the destination location. Should you want to
remove an acorn, drag it off of the ACORNS application frame and it will disappear.

<h3>Step 3: Attach links to other lessons</h3>
You can create links between lessons in a single ACORNS file during the setup process. These function like hyperlinks do on 
the Web. There are two ways to make a link. Both of these use options on the secondary toolbar and are described below.

<h3>Step 4: Execute the lesson</h3>
Once you have inserted a picture and attached some audio to places on it, your lesson is ready to 
execute. To execute, click on the icon that looks like a lightning bolt (<img align="center" src="../commonHelpSets/setupControls/run.png" >).

<h3>Note: Recovering from errors</h3>
If you make a mistake, ACORNS can help you recover. For example if you remove an acorn inadvertantly,
click on the undo icon on the ACORNS toolbar at the top of the frame. The acorn will return. The undo 
operation can also recover from changes made when you record sounds. After undoing, the redo button becomes active. You can 
redo an operation if you change your mind. 

<h3 align="left"><a name="secondary"></a>Secondary toolbar options</h3>
At the top of the setup panel, there is a secondary toolbar as shown in the picture below. This toolbar contains a series of 
grapic components and we will describe the purpose of each.

<table align="center"><tr><td align="center"><img src="data/toolbar.jpg" vspace="5"></td></tr></table>

<table border="1">
<tr><td><img src="../commonHelpSets/setupControls/helpButton.jpg"></td><td>When you click the help button, this page displays.
	The title you gave to this lesson when it was created appears to the right of the help button</td></tr>

<tr><td><img src="../commonHelpSets/setupControls/slider.jpg" align="left"></td><td>All ACORNS lessons can have multiple layers; each
	layer has an entirely separate list of acorns and links. This 
	feature can be useful to create lessons with multiple dialects. By switching between
	layers, the student can learn each dialects using the same lesson. This option can also be used to
	assign more difficult lessons to the higher layers. The slider
	on the control bar enables you to set up a lesson with multiple layers. Simply click
	on the slider to move to the desired layer. The layer numbers are numbered as shown on the picture
	to the left.</td></tr>

<tr><td><img src="../commonHelpSets/setupControls/rotate.png" align="left" ></td><td>The rotate button allows
   you to rotate the selected picture in ninety degree increments. This feature accommodates 
   pictures taken with the camera rotated. Click to select the picture, and then click the rotate
   button.</td></tr>

<tr><td><image src="../commonHelpSets/setupControls/resize.jpg" ></td><td>
	Picture and sound lessons allow you to scale images from twenty percent to five hundred percent of their 
	original size. This is especially useful to fit the image to the full screen size when the lesson executes. 
	ACORNS preserves scaled images across file open and save operations, so they are perminent unless you wish to 
	change them.<br><br> 
	To scale an image during lesson setup, click on the combo box menu and choose one of the options. 
	You can also type a scale factor of your choice if none of the menu options are appropriate.
		
<tr><td><img src="data/copyPasteAcorns.jpg" align="left" ></td><td>
	In some cases you might want the acorns and links to be in the same place in the different layers in your lesson. The Copy 
	and Paste Acorns buttons allows you to copy acorns from one layer and then paste them to another. Use these buttons
	as follows: (1) Move the slider to the layer containing the acorns and links that you want to copy; (2) Click the copy button 
	(the one shown on the left); (3) Move the slider to the layer where you want to paste the acorns; and (4) Click the paste 
	button (the one on the right). Your acorns will appear in the new layer.<br><br>

<tr><td><img src="data/acornLink.jpg" align="left"></td><td>
	To create a link within the picture, first make sure the button with the 'link' icon is pressed. Initially, the acorn icon 
	appears depressed and the chain link icon is not. Click on the icon that looks like a chain link so that it will display 
	depressed. You are then ready to make links to other lessons.
	<br><br>
	Click anywhere on the picture where the link should appear. ACORNS will then display a dialog box where you enter 
	the name of the lesson that you want to link to. The name field is one of the header fields that you fill in when you create 
	a new lesson. (You can modify it later if you didn't.) It shows in the lesson display area on the left of the ACORNS 
	application frame.
	<br><br>
	 
	After you click OK to the link dialog, a chain link icon will appear on the picture. As with acorns, you can drag it
	to reposition its spot, or drag it off the application frame should you want to remove it. If an illegal name is entered, the 
	link will appear when the lesson executes but will not be operational.<br><br>

	When you are finished adding links, it is a good idea to click on the acorn icon on the secondary toolbar. This will cause
	the acorn icon to become depressed; you are again ready to add more acorns.</td></tr>	

<tr><td><img src="../commonHelpSets/setupControls/anchor.png" align="left"></td><td>
	The link button allows you to connect this lesson with another lesson in the file. Clicking on
	this button causes a dialog window to appear.
	Enter the name of the lesson you want to link to. The name field is one of the header fields
	that you fill in when you create a lesson. (You can modify it later if you didn't.) It shows in the lesson display 
	area on the left of the ACORNS application frame. After you click OK to the link dialog, the name of the
	linked lesson will show in blue on the secondary toolbar.</td></tr>

This option copies acorns and links but without any data. You will need to record sounds and type in the link names after 
you finish the operation.
</td></tr>
