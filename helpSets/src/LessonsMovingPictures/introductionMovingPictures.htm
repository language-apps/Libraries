<p>A Moving Picture lesson will display four pictures that move about the frame. Students observe the
pictures and click on one of them. When they do, they hear an audio recording, and see the gloss (first language) translation
and indigenous spelling. Periodically, every twenty or thirty seconds, one of the pictures will
change, and the process continues.</p>

<p>Moving Picture lesson creation proceeds in two steps. 
The first step is to configure and set up the data appropriately. 
Refer to <a href="../commonHelpSets/setup.htm">Moving Pictures lesson Setup</a> for more details.  
The second step is to execute and we describe this process in the 
<a href="movingPicturesPlay.htm">Moving Pictures Execute</a> page.
This procedure is analogous to setting up Power Point slides and then running a Slide Show.</p>
