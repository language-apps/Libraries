<h1 align="center"><b>Introduction to Multiple Choice Lessons</b></h1>

<p>Multiple Choice lessons are very similar to those produced by popular commercial language learning
applications. You can add a series of pictures to a lesson. You can also record many sentences that
correspond to each picture. When the lesson executes, ACORNS will randomly select among the pictures and the 
recorded sound clips. The user clicks on the picture that he thinks that is correct.</p>

<p>Each lesson corresponds to a lesson theme. Lessons with different themes can be in a single ACORNS file. 
Users can use mouse clicks to navigate among these lessons.</p>

<p>Multiple Choice lessons are created in two steps. 
The first step is to configure and set up the data appropriately. 
Refer to <a href="../commonHelpSets/setup.htm">Multiple Pictures Setup</a> for more details.  
The second step is to execute the lesson as we describe in the
<a href="multPlay.htm">Multiple Choice Execution</a> page.
This procedure is analogous to setting up Power Point slides and then running a Slide Show.</p>
