<h2>Drag and drop facilities</h2>
<p>The WOLF application makes use of drag and drop to implement its features. We described this capability for incorporating
multimedia entities into dictionaries on the <a href="multimedia.html">multimedia</a> page. </p>

<p>You can also use drag and drop
to load dictionaries. Simply open the folder containing your WOLF dictionaries. The default location for WOLF files is 
the <em>Acorns</em> folder in your Documents folder.
Press the mouse on the file that you want, 
drag over the WOLF application frame, and release. WOLF will open the dictionary. A word of caution is in order though. This
feature may not work if a dictionary is already open. In this case, click the 
<img src="resources/close.png" alt="close.png" width="20" height="20"/>
icon to close the open dictionary first. You can use drag and drop to open WOLF dictionaries that were previously saved
(these have an <em>.adct</em> extension). You can also drag and drop wolf dictionaries that were exported. These have
an <em>.xml</em> extension.</p>

<p>On Windows and MAC systems, files with <em>.adct</em> extensions are normally associated with WOLF dictionaries. You can
automatically open a WOLF dictionary and the WOLF application by clicking on these files.</p>
