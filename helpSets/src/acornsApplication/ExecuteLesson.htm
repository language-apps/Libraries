select the execution option from the toolbar menu. When this command executes, a full screen view of the 
lesson displays and a lesson executes according to its design. Note that different types of lessons 
execute differently. Please refer to the Lesson help pages for more information.</p>.

<p>All lessons have a standard row of buttons that display at the bottom when the lesson executes.
