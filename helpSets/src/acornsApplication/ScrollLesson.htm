<h1 align="center"><b>Scroll Lessons</b></h1>

<p>You can scroll between lessons of a file in several ways. 
On the bottom of the <a href="LessonListLesson.htm">lesson list panel</a>, there are a series of 
buttons. Clicking these allows you to position to the first, previous, next, or last lesson in a file. 
These buttons respectively have the icon symbols shown below. The first button will do nothing if you already are at the 
first lesson in the file; the 
last button will do nothing if you are already at the last lesson in the file. Previous or next buttons 
will sound a beep if you try to position before the first lesson or beyond the last button.</p>

<p>The controls at the bottom of lessons in execute (play) mode also enable you to scroll
between lessons. An example of the navigation buttons show below. These work the same as what
we described above and enable you to position to the first, previous, next, or last lesson in a file.

<p>Finally, you can swicth be lessons by scrolling in the Lesson List Panel and then clicking on the
desired lesson. This will make the border of the lesson turn red and the details concerning this
lesson will show on the right.</p>
