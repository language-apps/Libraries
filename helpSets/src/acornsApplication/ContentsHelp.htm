<p>When you execute the help command, three tabs show on the left side of the display. One of these tabs has the label 
'Table of Contents'. If you select this option, all of the help topics show in a format that is similar to a book's table of 
contents.</p> 

<p>To navigate through the table of contents, click on the circles to the left of the folder icons. This action expands the 
corresponding section of the table of contents. Click again to contract the expanded view. If you click on a page icon, 
detailed information will display in the right panel of the Help Screen. For more generalized information about help refer to 
the <a href="OverviewHelp.htm">Help Overview</a></p>.
