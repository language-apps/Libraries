	  <p>You can select indigenous keyboard fonts by selecting the edit menu, then modify, and then fonts.
	  The above dialog frame appears when you execute this command.</p>
	  
	  <p>
      The selected fonts show in the middle window. To add a new font, choose a font and its size by
	  using the appropriate drop down selections at the top. Enter the language name that applies to this selection
	  in the text field on the top right. ACORNS will preview how the font looks on a line just above the
	  buttons appearing at the bottom of the frame. You can select any true type font (TTF) installed on your 
	  system. When you click on the Add/Modify button, the new font will add to the list shown in the center
	  window of the frame.</p>
	  
	  <p>
	  To modify an existing font, first select that font by clicking on the appropriate line in the center 
	  window. You can now change the font selection and then click again on add/modify. The altered information
	  will now display. If you want to remove a font, select the font to be removed and then click on the
	  Remove button on the bottom.</p>
	  
	  <p>The Set Active button determines which font ACORNS will use as a default. Any input in the program
	  where you type native words will appear using this font.</p>
	  
	  <p>The confirm button causes your changes to take effect. If you click the close button (the x), your
	  changes will be ignored.</p>
