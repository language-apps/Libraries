<h1 align="center"><b>Help Index</b></h1>

<p>When you execute the help command, three tabs show on the left side of the display. One of these tabs has the label 'Index'. 
If you select this option, all of the help topics show in a format that is similar to a book's index.</p> 

<p>To navigate through the index, click on the circles to the left of the folder icons. This action expands the corresponding 
section of the table of contents. Click again to contract the expanded view. If you click on a page icon, detailed information 
will display in the right panel of the Help Screen. For more generalized information about help refer to 
the <a href="OverviewHelp.htm">Help Overview</a></p>.
