<h1 align="center"><b>Switch Windows</b></h1>

<p>The ACORNS application allows multiple files to be open (active) at a time. In this case, 
you might need to switch between active files. This is easy; simply click on the name of the open file that 
shows on the Windows menu.</p>

<p> There are two ways to work with multiple open files. The <a href="FullViewWindows.htm">full view</a> mode 
is one mode and it is the default. The other is the <a href="TabbedViewWindows.htm">tabbed view of windows</a>. 
Using this second view, tabs will appear in the lesson display area for each open file. 
Just click on the one you want to work with.</p>
