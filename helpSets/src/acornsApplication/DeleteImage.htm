<p>The delete image command executes when you click the edit menu and then select the image option from the delete submenu. 
Use this command to remove an image from a lesson. 

<h3 align="center">Additional Notes</h3>

<p>Some lesson types require multiple images to be included. You can delete images in the setup mode of
these lessons by first clicking on the image in question (the border will turn red) and then
dragging the image off the frame. Doing this will cause it to disappear.</p>

<p>Deleting an image form picture and sound lessons removes the picture along with all recorded sounds and links. 
Refer to <a href="../LessonsPictures/picturesSetup.htm">picture and sound lesson setup</a> for more details.</p>

<p>This command is available only when there is an active lesson corresponding to the current file.
Otherwise the menu and toolbar options will appear faded (ghosted).</p>
