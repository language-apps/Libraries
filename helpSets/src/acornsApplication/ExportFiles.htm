<p>The export command executes when you choose the export option on the file menu. You can also execute 
the export command by clicking the <img src="data/export.png"> icon on the toolbar.</p>

<p>The export command is similar to a save operation, but it saves lesson information using XML. It also saves 
sound clips and images using industry standard formats such as JPEG and WAV. Export capabilities are the 
'best practice' approach to archive linguistics data because data is not subject to obsolescence because of 
software that developers no longer support.</p>

<p>When the export option runs, a dialog frame appears. This gives you the chance to select a file name for 
the export, and choose formats for how to save the image and sound files. You can later import the data into 
another ACORNS file or use it in other applications that understand XML. Refer to <a href="ImportFiles.htm"> 
import files</a> for more details. You may use the export feature when you have files that you want to archive 
for long term use.</p>

<h3 align="center">Additional Notes</h3>

<p>You can use the exported sound clips and images in other ACORNS lessons or in other application programs. 
Choose a file name to export your XML data to (e.g. 'landscape.xml'). The images and sound clips save in a 
folder whose name is the same, but without the extension (e.g. 'landscape'). Don't change the file names in 
that directory, if you intend to later use the ACORNS import command; the import command will not work 
correctly if you do this. Note that you can copy the image and sound files to other folders and name them 
as you wish.</p>

<p>The export option operates on the open active file (the one that displays). If no files are active, the 
export menu option is not available and will appear faded (ghosted).</p>
