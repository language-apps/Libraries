<h1 align="center"><b>Introduction to Hear and Respond Lessons</b></h1>

<p>Hear and Respond lessons consist of a recorded story along with a series of text annotations that
attach to places in the story. A set of annotations can be a translation of the story. It could be the
story spelled correctly in the indigenous language. Each Hear and Respond lesson can have up to ten 
annotation sets attached to the story.</p>

<p>When you execute a Hear and Respond lesson, you will hear the story and see it's annotated text with
blanks. The learning task is to fill in those blank words. In this way, you get practice hearing, 
comprehending, and learning the correct spellings.

<p>You create Hear and Respond lessons in two steps. The first step is to configure and set up 
the data appropriately. Refer to <a href="hearRespondSetup.htm">Hear and Respond lesson set up</a> for more 
details.  The second step is to execute the lesson as we describe in <a href="hearRespondPlay.htm">Hear and
Respond Execution</a>. This procedure is analogous to setting up Power Point slides and then running a 
Slide Show. The Hear and Respond setup panel allows some limited editing capabilities. If you need
to edit your recording more substantially, refer to the Sound Editor help pages.</p>
