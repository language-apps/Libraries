<h1 align=center>Executing Flash Card Lessons</h1>

<p>When you execute a flash card lesson, you will see three piles of cards at the top of the frame. 
Each card has a picture on it, and the top card of each pile shows. If a pile has no cards, you
will just see a background color on which the cards would rest.</p>

<p>After clicking on a card, you will hear one of the audio recorded phrases which are attached to that card.
After hearing the audio, click the correct phrase in the list of phrases shown at 
the bottom of the frame. If you are correct, you will hear feedback to acknowledge your success; otherwise
the audio feedback indicates that you should try again.</p>

<p>The object of the game is to get all the cards to the right most pile. By answering correctly a
sufficient number of times, you will see a card move to the middle pile. Answer more times correctly
and the card will go to the right pile. Incorrect answers might cause the card to go back to the left.</p>

<p>You can manually drag the cards from one pile to another. To do this, simply click, and while holding
the mouse down, drag the card to the desired pile. When you release the mouse, the card will appear on
the top of the destination pile. You can also move cards between piles by
clicking on the appropriate icon buttons under each pile. These buttons
contain a page and an arrow pointing in the desired direction.</p>

<p>There are three additional buttons that can appear under the card piles.
These enable you to respectively select the previous card, the next card, 
or a random card from a card pile.
