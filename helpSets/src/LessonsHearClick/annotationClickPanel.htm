<h1 align="center"><b>Annotating Audio Stories with Pictures</b></h1>

<p>A picture of the annotation panel follows below. In the center of this panel, you see a sound recording displayed
   visually. At the bottom, there is a series of annotations.</p>
<p>Sound is vibrations in pressure that travels
   through space. The wavy line displays these vibrations over time as a person speaks. The purpose
   of this panel is to be able to attach picture annotations to differenct places of the recording. There are a
   series of buttons surrounding the annotation panel. We will describe buttons all of the buttons and these functions 
   on linked pages.</p>


<p align="center"><img src="data/annotationClickPanel.png"></p>

<h2 align="center">Recording or loading a sound</h2>
The fist thing needed is to either record or load a pre-recorded sound.If you have a microphone and are ready to record, 
follow the instructions in the <a href="../soundEditor/recording.html">Recording</a> page. If you have 
pre-recorded audio, follow the instructions in the <a href="../soundEditor/loadSave.html">File Management</a> page.

<h2 align="center">Selecting a portion of a sound recording</h2>

The next thing we need to do to attach an annotation to a sound recording is to select the portion of the
panel of interest. This procedure is used consistently in this program, so it is a good idea to get familiar
with how it is done. First, drag your mouse over the desired portion of a recording. If you click the play back button 
(<img src="../soundEditor/soundControls/play.png" valign="middle" >) you will hear the audio corresponding to the section of the 
sound wave that you select.


<p>The picture below shows a portion of the panel that is selected. Notice that the highlighted area is
shaded. If you click the mouse again the selection is released.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="data/clickAnnotationSelection.png"></p>

<p>The selection shows the portion of the sound wave where the story is speaking about a green animated
figure. It shows the green animated figure attached to that portion of the sound wave. To attach a picture in this way,
simply select the appropriate portion of the sound wave, click on the icon with the picture of camera on the
ACORNS toolbar(The top toolbar, not the secondary toobar in the lesson setup panel).  Use the file dialog box to find 
the picture you want to attach. There are ACORNS help pages that describe inserting pictures in more detail should the above 
description be insufficient.</p>
<p>Note that you can also use the insert image procedure to insert a background picture for your lesson. To do this, just click on the 
camera when you do not have an area of the sound wave selected. ACORNS then assumes that you want to change the background. 
In the diagram below, the background shows with a blue color.</p>
<p>Should you want to remove a picture annotation, first click somewhere within the picture you want to remove. A vertical 
line will show after you do this. Then click on the edit toobar at the top of the ACORNS window, then click on delete, and 
then choose picture. If you click somewhere outside of your picture annotations, ACORNS assumes that you are deleting the 
background picture.</p>

<h2 align="center">Annotation Panel Buttons and Controls</h2>
<p>
      If you make a mistake, error messages display in red at the bottom of the panel. Sometimes 
      ACORNS acknowledges what it is doing by displaying a message in this area. The 
      <a href="../soundEditor/errors.html">Error</a> page describes the kind of messages that can display. You can 
	  also undo and redo your last operation (Refer to the ACORNS 
	  <a href="../soundEditor/redoUndo.html"> Redo and Undo</a> page for more information).
      </p><p>
      While you are setting up a Hear and Click lesson, there are a series of buttons to assist. As you move your mouse over 
	  the various buttons, you will see a short description of the component. This can help if you forget 
      what a particular component does. We have help pages that describe the operation of of the 
      various buttons. You can click on the image links below to learn how these buttons and controls work.
