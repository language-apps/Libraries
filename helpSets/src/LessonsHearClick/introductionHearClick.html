<h1 align="center"><b>Introduction to Hear and Click Lessons</b></h1>

<p>Hear and Click lessons consist of a recorded story along with a series of pictures that
attach to places in the story. A set of annotations can be still or animated pictures that relate to portions 
of the story. Each Hear and Respond lesson can have up to ten annotation layers that could pertain to different 
native dialects or different stories.</p>

<p>When you execute a Hear and Respond lesson, you will hear the story and see the annotated pictures. 
The learning task is to click on the correct picture when the story comes to the place appropriate to that 
picture. In this way, you get practice hearing and comprehending. This lesson type is very immersive, 
in that no gloss (first language wording) is included.

<p>You create Hear and Click lessons in two steps. The first step is to configure and set up 
the data appropriately. Refer to <a href="annotationClickSetup.htm"> Hear and Click Setup</a> for more 
details.  The second step is to execute the lesson as we describe in the 
<a href="annotationClickPlay.htm">Hear and Click Execution</a> page. 
This procedure is analogous to setting up Power Point slides and then running a 
Slide Show. The Hear and Click setup panel also allows some limited sound editing capabilities to help you
customize your lesson.  If you need to edit your recording more substantially, refer to the Sound Editor help pages.
