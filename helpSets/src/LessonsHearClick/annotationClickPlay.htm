<h1 align="center"><b>Executing a Hear and Click Lesson</b></h1>

<p>When you execute a hear and click lesson, you will see a series of pictures displaying, and the program plays 
back an audio story recording that relates to the pictures that show. Your job is to click on the correct picture when the part of 
the story that plays back relates. When you click your mouse on one of the pictures, you will hear an acknowledgment audio 
to let you know if you are correct or not.</p>

<p>
The score in the upper right corner will show how you are doing as you continue clicking on pictures
as the recording plays. After the lesson completes, the process will start all over again, this time
with possibly different pictures displaying in different places in the display window. Depending on how the lesson is set up
there can be more pictures than show in a particular session. Each time you execute the lesson, you will see a different set
of pictures displaying. Note that the pictures can be animated GIF files. This makes is possible to  set up lessons that convey
action.
</p>

<p>At the top of the display, there are icon buttons that can help. If you 
want to replay the last part of the recording again simply click the replay 
button. Similarly, the button with the blue circle is for showing the answer 
(the correct picture highlights). There is also a button to pause the audio. 
Finally, the play button continues to the next pause point.</p>

<h3>Play Control Panel</h3>
<p>On the bottom of your display you will see a row of buttons that are standard across all lesson types. For more 
information <a href="../commonHelpSets/playControls.htm">Click Here</a>. Clicking on the middle button
(<img src="../commonHelpSets/playControls/info.png">) causes a pop up menu to appear, which has options that are unique for each
lesson type. Hear and Click lesson options are shown with explanations below.</p>

	<table border="1"><tr>
		<td>Reset&nbsp;lesson<br>
			Increase&nbsp;Difficulty&nbsp;Level&nbsp;from&nbsp;Moderate<br>

			Select&nbsp;Continuous&nbsp;Play&nbsp;Mode</td>

		The first option allows you to reset the game, which means redrawing different pictures at different places.<br><br>
		You can use the next two options to select either of the top two options to respectively adjust the difficulty level 
		of the lesson. A greater difficulty level will cause more pictures to display (if they are available). <br><br>
		The last option toggles between continuous play and standard play. Continuous play sounds the audio straight through,
		with a short pause at the points that relates to each picture. The program will highlight the correct picture with a 
		red border, and then continue onto the next. Standard play stops and has you select which picture corresponds to the 
		audio.
