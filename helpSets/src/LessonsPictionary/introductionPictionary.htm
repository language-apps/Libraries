<p>A Pictionary lesson will display a series of pictures. Students observe the
pictures and click on one of them. When they do, they hear an audio recording, and see the gloss (first language) translation,
indigenous spelling, and additional descriptive information.</p>

<p>Pictionary lesson creation proceeds in two steps. 
The first step is to configure and set up the data appropriately. 
Refer to <a href="../commonHelpSets/setup.htm">Pictionary lesson Setup</a> for more details.  
The second step is to execute and we describe this process in the 
<a href="pictionaryPlay.htm">Pictionary Lesson Execute</a> page.
This procedure is analogous to setting up Power Point slides and then running a slide show.</p>
