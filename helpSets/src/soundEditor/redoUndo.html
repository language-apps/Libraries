      <p>
      When manipulating sound recordings, it is easy to make mistakes. The Acorns Sound Editor keeps
      track of the operations that you execute. If you make a mistake, simply press the undo button
      (<img align="middle" src="soundControls/undo.png" >). If you change your mind, press the redo button 
      (<img align="middle" src="soundControls/redo.png" >). The sound wave you see will reflect your command.
      </p>
      <p>
      Redo and undo operations apply to the various edit commands. Zooming, volume,and speed controls
      can easily be undone, so these operations are not recorded for undo.
      </p>
      <p>
      When you erase, load, or record, the history of undo commands erases. Be careful when you 
      execute these options. If you try to redo or undo and there is nothing that can be done, you
      will see an error message at the bottom of the sound panel.
