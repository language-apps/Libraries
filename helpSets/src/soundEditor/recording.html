      <h2 align="center">Sound and Annotation Panel Recording Buttons</h2>
      <p>
      The recording buttons allow you to record and play back sounds. There are five
      recording buttons. Each are described below.
      </p>
      <table align="center" border="1">
      <tr>
         <td valign="top">Scroll Front&nbsp;&nbsp;<img align="top" src="soundControls/first.png" ></td>
         <td>
            This button is useful when you use the zoom options (see 
            <a href="zoom.html">Zoom Controls</a> for details) so the entire recording doesn't fit
            in the sound display window. The Scroll Front button will redisplay the beginning part
            of the sound wave. If there is no sound wave showing in the wave window of the
            panel, you will see an error message display at the bottom of the sound panel.
         </td>
      </tr><tr>
         <td valign="top">Record&nbsp;&nbsp;<img align="top" src="soundControls/record.png" ></td>
         <td>
            You press this button when you are ready to record. Make sure that your microphone
            is ready. Headphone microphones tend to work the best because the computer hears
            less background noise. If you use a standard microphone, make sure that it is positioned
            close to but on the side of your mouth. When you press the record button, begin to
            speak clearly into the microphone. The Sound Editor program hears and records your words.
            There should be a message on the bottom of the sound panel indicating that 
            the recording is active.
            <p>Be careful. When you press record, the Sound Editor will erase a previously recorded
            sound. You can, however, click on a spot in a sound wave or select an area. Recording will
			then be sandwiched between the unselected areas.</p>
        </td>
      </tr><tr>
         <td valign="top">Play&nbsp;&nbsp;<img align="top" src="soundControls/play.png" ></td>
         <td>
            This button plays back a recording. It is useful to hear the sound of a wave
            displayed in the sound window at the center of the panel. You can select portions of 
            a recorded sound for play back (see the <a href="selection.html">selection</a> page for 
            details). 
            <p>
            You will see an error message if there is no recording to play. 
            </p>
         </td>
      </tr><tr>
         <td valign="top">Stop&nbsp;&nbsp;<img align="top" src="soundControls/stop.png" ></td>
         <td>
            Use this button to stop the recording process. You will see an error message if you 
            try to stop recording if there is no recording in progress.
         </td>
      </tr><tr>
         <td valign="top">Scroll Back&nbsp;&nbsp;<img align="top" src="soundControls/last.png" ></td>
         <td>
            This button is useful when you have zoomed into the sound recording (see 
            <a href="zoom.html">Zoom Controls</a> for details) so the entire recording doesn't fit
            in the sound display window. The Scroll Back button will redisplay the last part
            of the sound wave. If there is no sound wave showing in the wave window of the
            panel, you will see an error message display at the bottom of the sound panel.
         </td>
      </tr><tr>
