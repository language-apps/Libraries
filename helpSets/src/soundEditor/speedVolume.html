      <h2 align="center">Speed and Volume Control Buttons</h2>
      <p>
      The speed control buttons allow you to speed up and slow down how fast a recorded
      sound plays. Speed up and slow down apply to the entire sound wave, not selected portions.
      </p>
      The volume control buttons enable you to cause a recorded sound play louder or 
      softer. The volume buttons apply to selected portions of a sound wave. 
      </p>

         <td>
         Pressing this button causes to recording to play about ten percent faster. The Sound Editor program
		 maintains the pitch as the speed changes, but there can be distortion if you click this button too
		 many times. Therefore, use this option with care.

      <tr>
         <td valign="top">Increase Volume&nbsp;<img align="middle" src="soundControls/volumeup.png" ></td>
         <td>
         Pressing this button causes the volume to increase about ten percent. If you use this command
         too much, you can reach the maximum amplitude. Further increases will not increase the
         volume, and will clip the top parts of the sounds. This can result in some distortion when you
         play it back. 
         </td>
      </tr><tr>
         <td valign="top">Decrease Volume&nbsp;<img align="middle" src="soundControls/volumedown.png" ></td>
         <td>
         Pressing this button causes the volume to decrease about ten percent. If you use this command
         too much, you can lose resolution of the softer sounds. This can cause distortion when you
         play it back.
         </td>
         </td>
      </tr><tr>
         <td valign="top">Normalize&nbsp;<img align="middle" src="soundControls/normalize.png" ></td>
         <td>
            The normalize button increases the sound as much as possible without distortion. If a 
            small portion of the signal is very loud, it could appear as if the command doesn't work.
            If the loud portion is very small (a few microseconds), you might not be able to hear it.
            Normalize will work if you first silence or lower the volume of the portion of the wave 
            that is loud. You can find this part by zooming in and looking for the high amplitude 
            sections in the display. Refer to the <a href="display.html">sound display</a> page
            for details as to how sounds display.
