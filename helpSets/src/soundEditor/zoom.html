      The zoom in and out buttons allow you to focus in on a particular portion of a sound recording.
      When you initially record a sound wave, it shows in its entirety in the sound panel's display 
      window. Each time you zoom, the portion that displays is cut by a half. You then need to use the
      scroll bar to see other portions of the wave. The zoom features are useful when you want to
      exactly see where words start and end. Zooming still keep the selected area highlighted.</p>

      <tr>
         <td align="top">Zoom In&nbsp;<img align="middle" src="soundControls/zoomin.png" ></td>
         <td>
         Pressing this button doubles the space needed to display the sound recording. You will need
         to use the scroll panel to see portions of the sound wave.

      <tr>

         Pressing this button undos the effect of pressing the zoom in button.

         <td>
         Pressing this button causes the selected portion of the sound wave to show on the entire
         wave display window, if possible. Sometimes the program can reach its maximum zoom
         capacity. In this case, it might still be necessary to scroll to see the selected area.

      </tr><tr>
         <td valign="top">Zoom All&nbsp;<img align="middle" src="soundControls/zoomall.png" ></td>
         <td>
         Pressing this button zooms the entire sound recording to fit the display window. This is the 
		 default setting.
