      <h2 align="center">Annotation Control Buttons</h2>
      <p>
      The annotation control buttons allow you to enter and modify text annotations that you attach to particular portions
      of a sound recording. By using the export button, you can save the audio recording with these annotations
      for later import into ACORNS or another program that can use them. The picture below shows a slider, a
	  drop down menu for changing languages, a text field that you use to create and maintain your annotations,
      and three buttons. The annotation procedure described on this page is different
      than those described on the web page for <a href="annotations.html">annotations</a> in
      editing mode. Those annotations go with the entire recording; they are not attached to a particular
      section of the recording.

         <td>
            You can attach up to ten sets of annotations to a recording. For example, the first
            set of annotations can be a translation to English. The second could be the properly spelled
            words in the native language. One annotation can be a very literal translation. Another can
            be more paraphrased. Different annotations could be translations into different indigenous
            languages. You use this slider to select which annotation set you are editing. The slider screen
            shot to the left shows the slider pointer on the first tick mark (first annotation set). With 
            the mouse, drag this slider pointer to the  other tick marks to work with a different set of 
            annotations.</td>

			You can select a different indigenous keyboard for each annotation set. To learn more

         <td>
            You use this text field to enter the annotations that you want to attach to a sound
            recording. First select the particular area of the recording to which the annotation applies.
            The way we select is to use the mouse dragging capability. To do this, first press the 
            mouse at the starting position in a sound display window. Then holding the pressed down 
            position, drag your mouse to the ending position. Then release. You should see the portion of 
            a sound that you selected highlighted in the wave display window. 
            <br><br>
            Once you enter the appropriate annotation text, click on one of the navigation buttons 
            that we describe below.
         </td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
         <td valign="top">Add an Annotation<br><img align="middle" src="soundControls/add.png" ></td>
         <td>
            To add an annotation select the desired area of a sound recording, enter the annotation
            using the text field. To add line breaks, type the characters <i>\n</i> and this
			will cause the display to skip lines when the text shows as the lesson
			executes. When you are finished typing, click the add button. If your annotation goes over 
			other annotations previously entered, it will replace those. If it partially replaces an 
			annotation on either one side or another, those annotations will be partially replaced.
         </td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
         <td valign="top">Remove an Annotation<br><img align="middle" src="soundControls/garbage.png" ></td>
         <td>
            To remove one or more annotations, select the area to be removed and click the button that
            looks like a garbage can. If you partially remove an annotation to the right, that annotation
            will extend and fill up the area to the left. You can then insert a blank annotation if you
            wish to truncate the extended annotation. You can also use modify to clear the annotation (see
            below) and then insert an annotation over the desired area.
         </td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
         <td valign="top">Modify an Annotation<br><img align="middle" src="soundControls/edit.png" ></td>
         <td>
            If you wish to modify the text for an annotation, don't select it's area as you do with
            add and remove. Just click somewhere within the annotation. You will see a vertical line
            drawn from top to bottom of the panel and the original text will display in the
			text field at the bottom. Then modify the text as desired and click the modify
            button. You will see the text change in the annotation display.
         </td>
      </tr><tr>       
      </table>

      <p>As a final note, the annotations you enter show in the display area below the sound wave. The
         annotations display left to right using word wrapping. However, if a word is to long to fit
         within its prescribed area, it will be split vertically. You can use the zoom option to expand
         the sound wave. This can be helpful for entering annotations because they show up in the display
         in a more readable fashion. Check out the <a href="zoom.html">zoom controls</a> for more 
         information about using the zoom option.</p>
