      <h2>ACORNS Sound Editor Application Overview</h2>
      <p>
      The ACORNS project supports language revitalization efforts of Native 
      American tribes. The name, [AC]quisition [O]f [R]estored [N]ative [S]peech is in honor of the 
      tribes of Northern California and Southern Oregon where the acorn is a central part of the 
      traditional life.  This project is a long term development project involving 
      both undergraduate and graduate students. We appreciate comments and feedback.
      </p>
      <p>The Sound Editor works in two modes. The first, editing mode, enables you to edit and 
      manipulate sound files.
      You can copy or cut words and phrases to create new sound files. You can alter the volume of the 
      recordings, and speed up or slow the play back. Additionally, you can add gloss(normally English) 
      and native annotations to the recordings. The release supports all indigenous fonts stored in
	  <i>ttf</i> format. ACORNS conforms to best practice criteria 
      for working with linguistic data, in that it supports standard file formats through its export 
      and import facilities.</p>
	  <p>The second Sound Editor mode of operation, annotation mode, allows you to 
      add up to ten levels of text annotations to any portion of a sound recording. This feature is 
      necessary for creating ACORNS hear and respond lessons.
