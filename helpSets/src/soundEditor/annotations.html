      An annotation is text that describes the recorded file. You use the two text boxes at the bottom
      of an ACORNS sound panel to annotate your sound recordings. These annotations attach to the 
      entire recording. Refer to the <a href="annotationPanel.htm">Annotation Panel</a> web page if you
      want to annotate specific places in the recording.

      The gloss text box allows you to 
      type a gloss language (normally English) description of the sound. The native text box allows 
      you to type the description of the sound in your native language. If you want to save these 
      annotations, don't use the browse or save buttons. Those options save the sound recording 
      without the annotations. Instead, use the import button for browse, and the export button for 
      save. These options make use of two files. The first is a standard formatted sound file. The second 
      is a text file with an .xml extension containing the gloss and native text. This conforms with
      the best practices for handling linguistic data because none of the files are stored in 
      proprietary formats. The ACORNS application will load the recording with the gloss and native text 
	  in the dialogs that it uses to browse for audio files when you create lessons.

      Your native language annotation can utilize a specialized keyboard. Just select the appropriate
      language using the drop down menu at the bottom of the sound panel. Currently we support the
      Cherokee Nation, Tsalagi, and Chinook alphabets. It is easy to extend this list. Contact the author
      Dan Harvey at <a href="mailto:harveyd@sou.edu">harveyd@sou.edu</a> if you are interested in 
      adding additional keyboards.
